	<h3>(#Intro) Intro</h3>
	<p>
		Some groundbreaking news. There are countries beyond the UK and the USA that produce good music.
I know, it’s shocking. And you might need some time to comprehend this.
Remarkably the press you read won’t tell you about Ukrainian music. You’ll be informed about wars, disasters, and conflicts happening in foreign countries but not about their culture and art. So pacifistic.
This is a shame as you’re missing on something fairly gorgeous and alluring.
So my intention is to reclaim this nuisance. And I can humbly say — this is nothing less than an act of kindness from my side. An incredible gift that you shall not forget and cherish for the rest of your life.
I’m just kidding.
But, surely, discovering Ukrainian music can be a life-changing experience. It’ll add more color and flavor to your life. You might indeed become a better person after listening to some fine specimen of this genre.
So, please, let me be your guide and help you to explore, perhaps, something new.
Before we dive into this indulgence, I shall make a few brief points or observations on why is Ukrainian music so indescribably amazing.
The Language, Instruments and Ethnic Tunes
The language definitely makes the Ukrainian music somewhat of the eighth wonder of the world. Yes, I know what you think. Slavic languages are an acquired taste (no insult is intended here). I can understand if you aren’t very fond of them. Indeed, they might sound harsh on the first encounter.
But the Ukrainian language is an exception to this rule. It has more soft consonants than other members of the Proto-Slavic language group. This makes the sound of it actually mellow to a delicate ear and free of obvious roughness. And in some magical way, those slight variations in phonetics give the Ukrainian language incredible fruitiness. It almost feels like it was specifically designed for signing rather than speaking.
And then — as a pleasant complement — you get folk tunes and traditional instruments that play a huge role in the making of a modern Ukrainian melody. You will notice the prominence of woodwind instruments, like Ukrainian sopilka or Armenian duduk, in the arrangements of many contemporary Ukrainian artists.
Though used to this by now, hearing a new song with the sound of duduk still channels some grand emotions in me, making me feel like I reunite with my ancestral heritage.
Okay, this sounds grossly pathetic.
Let’s just say that I find Ukrainian music refreshing. A good way to escape the world dominated by tropical and Latino sounds.
And now it’s time to do exactly that.

<section id="Alina Pash">
	<h3>(#Alina Pash) Alina Pash</h3>
	<p>
		I must mention this beautiful creature. Alina Pash has a lot of potential for becoming an excellent artist with an original and zingy image. She has only released two songs but both of them are excellent. Alina is trying to marry hip-hop and folk genres, decorating her music with the Ukrainian street dialect. “Bitanga” is, for sure, a robust anthem to free creativity and crossover fashion.

	<h3>(#alyona alyona) alyona alyona</h3>
	<p>
		alyona alyona is a hip-hop artist with an unusual packaging for both local and international music landscapes. She can drop a truly catchy tune and communicate a message with meaning and substance while neglecting the common-or-garden bawdry typical for this genre of music. This lady knows who she is and she knows how she looks, and this sober realization of one’s own identity allows her to be ironic, honest and ultimately sensational.

<section id="ONUKA">
	<h3>(#ONUKA) ONUKA</h3>
	<p>
		ONUKA’S music is the space where the experimentality and boldness of electronic sound meet the harmony and tranquillity of folk tradition. The band prominently and intentionally uses Ukrainian folk instruments to channel indigenous and primordial energy. The latest single “Strum” is ONUKA’S best attempt to fuse tradition and progress into coherent and conclusive sound.
